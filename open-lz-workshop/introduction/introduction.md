# Introduction

Estimated Time: 60 - 90 minutes


## About this Workshop

Designing and coding your Landing Zone can be a complex, time consuming, and an extremely costly task, requiring deep design and IaC skills. Worst of all, when you reach the coding part it's like reinventing the wheel, i.e., you will hard-code your solution, which is hard to justify in the present days. The OCI Open LZ was creates with this in minds, to help you tailor your OCI landing zone with a reference design, and help you setup OCI resources in a human-readable Terraform native configuration, which is easy to operate and maintain, reducing drastically the complexity of onboarding and day two operations. The OCI Open LZ is an end-to-end runnable blueprint that utilises the configurable CIS Landing Zones Enhanced Modules to automate the provisioning and change of tailored Landing Zones.
